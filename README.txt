Poker game following the rules of Texas Holdem and playing against the house. Command line interface.

As it stands, Fold or bet does not do anything other than push the game forward. So therefore nothing can be bet just yet.

I was a little too ambitious with this game in the timeframe. 
The logic of this game was especially tricky because of the Texas Holdem rules. 
A hand can have 7 cards in it which has to be brought down to the best 5. 
Straights and Flushes were the main issue with logic.
I will add more in the future as a personal project

game may still have more bugs.
